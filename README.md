# `tinycostandweightestimator`

This is meant to do rough napkin math on the cost and weight of a Tiny House. 

Put in your length, it'll do the rest. 

None of the big box stores have a decent API for me to pull most recent pricing from, so I'll be sourcing weights and prices myself. Which sucks, but what are you going to do?
