    Here are my assumptions.
    <ul>Here are my assumptions. 
      <li>Walls are 2x4s, every 24". </li>
      <li>Floor and ceiling joists are 2x6s, every 16". </li>
      <li>End walls are 8' wide. (close enough for napkin math) </li>
      <li>Side walls are length of the trailer. </li>
      <li>Price per foot of lumber is about the same for a given dimensional lumber. (8' 2x6 is the same cost per foot as a 12' 2x6) </li>
      <li>Trailer costs don't fluctuate much. We get our rough trailer costs from Iron Eagle Trailers.</li>
      <li>You're using metal roofing. </li>
      <li>You're doing a shed style roof. </li>
